# comcast-blocker

This is a chrome extension that hides the copywrite warnings sent out by comcast by changing the popup div to display:none

I live in a building with multiple people from different apartments using the same wifi. One or more of them have been torrenting files that are monitored by comcast and thus I get a popup about copywrite infringement that doesn’t have a way to delete it. Instead of having to open up dev tools and turn the popup to display none I wrote this extension which does this automatically so I don’t get annoyed by Comcast every third site
